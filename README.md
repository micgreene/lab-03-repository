Project Description:

This page is meant to display a list of image objects that are retrieved from a .json file using an asynchronous request ($.ajax()).

When the user selects a keyword from the dropdown, the images possessing a similar keyword description will remain displayed and all others will be hidden.

If the user selects the default dropdown keyword, then all photos are shown on the page again.

This new lab uses an outside script (mustache.js) to  create a template in the .html files that are referenced and then reassigned dynamically with properties using functions in our own .js files.

A second dropdown menu has been added to allow the user to sort the images displayed by either alphabetically thru title or thru the number of "horns" the image has been assigned via an property value.

The images on screen are now sorted by the title or number of horns, then filtered according to the keyword value of each object in addition to that.
